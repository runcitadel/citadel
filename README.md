Citadel allows you to run your own Bitcoin Lightning node and personal server. It is proudly **free and open-source** software. Anyone is free to use, copy, study and change the software in any way as well as distribute it for commercial purposes.

### Our mission

We aim to provide secure nodes and servers for everyone where _you_ are in control of your data, not a big company. We make contributions to various open source projects used on Citadel to make sure we're giving back to the community we build on.

## Citadel vs. Umbrel

Citadel is a mostly open source and soon to be fully FLOSS Lightning Node implementation based on [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel). Most of the codebase has been rewritten and moved away from Umbrel. Citadel offers many improvements over Umbrel:

- faster operating system optimized for Raspberry Pi
- independent and therefore faster app updates
- our own, up-to-date user interface with built-in dark mode
- listening mode by default

## Roadmap

Citadel is fully transparent and built by the community. To see milestones and follow current development view the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/runcitadel/projects/3).
